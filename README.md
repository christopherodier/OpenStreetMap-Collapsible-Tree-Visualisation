# OpenStreetMap-Collapsible-Tree-Visualisation

http://threefiftythree.com/openstreetmap-a-collapsible-tree-visualisation

This is an OpenStreetMap stack visualisation using D3 library. An interactive Reingoldâ€“Tilford tree structure based on a JSON file is generated by D3.

This is mostly based on the OSM wiki. Hopefully it can be useful for people who are starting with OSM and help them to make sense of the vast OSM world.

There is a downloadable version that works offline > osm-tree-offline.zip

Please send me your feedback, comments, suggestions, critiques and if you want to contribute and collaborate, you're welcome to do so!

Suggestions:
- Adding entries to the JSON file to make it more complete.
- Translasting into other languages.
- Improved the code in terms of usability.
